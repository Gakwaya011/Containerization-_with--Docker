# Project Name: Project Management Web Application

## Description

This project aims to revolutionize people's management of personal projects and tasks by providing a simple, user-friendly web application. Users can create, manage, and track their projects and tasks efficiently. This minimal viable product (MVP) is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is containerized using Docker to ensure easy deployment and scalability across different environments.

## Background Context

Imagine being part of a dynamic startup that leverages modern technology to ensure smooth development workflows and deployment processes. To align with this philosophy, Docker is used to encapsulate the application in a container, making it easy to deploy, scale, and manage across any environment.

## Task Description

### Web Application Development

The web application features include:

- Ability to add new tasks.
- View the list of tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.

### Containerization with Docker

Dockerfile includes:

- Base image specification.
- Installation of any dependencies.
- Copying application code into the container.
- Exposing the port on which the application runs.
- Specifying the command to run the application.

## Real-Life Scenario

The startup plans to present this MVP at an upcoming tech conference to attract potential investors and early adopters. The ability to quickly deploy and scale the application in response to user feedback is crucial for its success. Using Docker demonstrates the team's technical proficiency and commitment to modern, efficient development practices.

## Deliverables

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Gakwaya011/Containerization_with-Docker): Contains the source code of the web application and the Dockerfile.
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gakwaya/containerization_todo-app/general): Docker image hosted on Docker Hub.
